# Test Comment Cleanup Feature

This file tests the new failure comment cleanup feature.

## New Feature
When a PR is successfully linked to an issue, the workflow now automatically removes any existing failure comments.

## Test Scenario
1. Create PR with no issue link → failure comment appears
2. Add issue link (via PR body or GitHub UI) → workflow succeeds  
3. Failure comment should be automatically removed

## Expected Behavior
Branch: `test-comment-cleanup` (no issue pattern)

### Phase 1: Initial Failure
- ❌ Workflow fails (no issue found)
- 📝 Failure comment appears with fix instructions

### Phase 2: Manual Fix (to be done after PR creation)
- ✏️ Edit PR body to add "This PR fixes: #123"
- ✅ Workflow succeeds on next run
- 🗑️ **Failure comment disappears automatically**
- 📝 Success comment appears for issue linking

## Benefits
- Clean PR conversations
- Clear resolution indication  
- Reduced noise in PR comments
- Professional appearance

This validates the complete user journey from failure → guidance → resolution → cleanup.

Branch: test-comment-cleanup
Expected: Failure comment cleanup when issue is resolved
