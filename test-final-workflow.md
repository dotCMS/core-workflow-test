# Test Final Workflow Version

This file tests the complete enhanced workflow with all final improvements.

## Latest Updates Included:
1. ✅ **Improved comment parsing** - Fixed grep errors and duplicate headers
2. ✅ **Updated failure comment** - Emphasizes PR body keywords for auto-cleanup
3. ✅ **Clarified limitations** - Clear guidance about GitHub UI linking
4. ✅ **Removed maintainer references** - Since all developers are maintainers
5. ✅ **Better PR list handling** - Prevents duplicates and parsing errors

## Expected Behavior:
Branch name: `test-final-workflow-version` (no issue pattern)

### Phase 1: Initial Failure
- ❌ Workflow fails (no issue found)
- 📝 Failure comment appears with updated guidance:
  - **Option 1: Add keyword to PR body (Recommended - auto-removes this comment)**
  - **Option 2: Link via GitHub UI (Note: won't clear the failed check)**
  - **Option 3: Use branch naming**

### Phase 2: Test Auto-Cleanup (Optional)
- ✏️ Edit PR body to add "This PR fixes: #123" 
- ✅ Workflow succeeds and removes failure comment
- 📝 Success comment appears for issue linking

## Key Improvements Tested:
- 🔧 **No parsing errors** in comment handling
- 🎯 **Clear user guidance** toward best option
- 🔄 **Transparent limitations** for each option
- ✨ **Professional comment formatting**

This validates the complete enhanced workflow is production-ready.

Branch: test-final-workflow-version
