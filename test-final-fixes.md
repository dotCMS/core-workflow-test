# Test Final Fixes for Issue #385

This branch `issue-385-test-final-fixes` tests the enhanced workflow with both fixes:

1. **Fixed comment formatting** - Comments should now have proper newlines instead of `\n` text
2. **Added PR-issue linking** - The workflow should automatically add issue reference to PR body

Expected workflow behavior:
- Extract issue #385 from branch name
- Create properly formatted comment on issue #385
- Add issue reference to this PR's body (creates GitHub link)
- Complete successfully
