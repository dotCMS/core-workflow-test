# Test No-Checkout Workflow for Issue 389

This file tests the optimized workflow without repository checkout.

## Optimization Applied
Removed the checkout step entirely:
```yaml
# REMOVED:
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
```

## Why this works
The workflow only needs to:
- Make GitHub API calls with `curl` 
- Use `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment` action
- Process input parameters (pr_branch, pr_url, etc.)

No repository files are actually needed!

## Expected Benefits
- âš¡ Faster execution (no clone time)
- ðŸ“¦ Reduced bandwidth usage  
- ðŸ’¾ Lower resource consumption
- ðŸ”§ Simpler workflow maintenance

2. Create comment on issue #389 without any checkout errors
3. Add "This PR fixes: #389" to PR body
4. Complete workflow faster than before
