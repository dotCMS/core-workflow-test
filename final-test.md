# Final Workflow Test

This file tests the complete workflow with all fixes applied:

1. ✅ YAML syntax errors fixed
2. ✅ Comment formatting fixed (no literal \n)
3. ✅ PR-issue linking functionality added
4. ✅ Using fork issues instead of parent repository

Expected behavior:
- Should detect issue #123 from branch name
- Should create properly formatted comment on issue #123
- Should add issue reference to PR body for automatic GitHub linking
- Should handle all cases gracefully

Branch: issue-123-final-workflow-test
Issue: #123 (fork repository issue)
