# Test Fixed Workflow 

This branch `issue-888-test-workflow-fixed` tests the enhanced workflow with the syntax fix applied.

Expected behavior:
1. Extract issue number 888 from branch name
2. Successfully make API call to get issue comments
3. Attempt to create/update comment on issue #888
4. Complete successfully (or fail gracefully if issue doesn't exist)
