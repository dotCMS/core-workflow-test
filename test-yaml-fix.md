# Test YAML Fix - Final

This file tests the YAML syntax fix for the failure comment feature.

## Issue Fixed
The YAML syntax error was on line 271:
```
error parsing called workflow ".github/workflows/issue_open-pr.yml" -> "./.github/workflows/issue_comp_link-issue-to-pr.yml" : You have an error in your yaml syntax on line 271
```

## Root Cause
The issue was using a heredoc (`cat <<'EOF'`) inside YAML, which can cause parsing conflicts with the YAML parser.

## Fix Applied
Changed from:
```bash
comment_body=$(cat <<'EOF'
## ❌ Issue Linking Required
...
EOF
)
```

To:
```bash
comment_body='## ❌ Issue Linking Required

This PR could not be linked to an issue...'
```

## Test Goals
This branch name (`test-yaml-fix-final`) has NO issue pattern, so it should:
1. ✅ **Pass YAML validation** (no syntax errors)
2. ❌ **Fail workflow** (no issue found)
3. 📝 **Add helpful comment** to PR with fix instructions

## Expected Comment Content
- Clear error message with ❌ emoji
- 3 specific fix options (GitHub UI, PR body, branch naming)
- Educational explanation about why issue linking is required
- Professional formatting

Branch: test-yaml-fix-final
Expected: YAML validation passes, workflow fails gracefully with helpful comment
